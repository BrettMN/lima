# Security Policy

This project only provides the Mudlib for the FluffOS driver, and as such should not contain security issues that can be abused from the internet (that is outside of our responsibility). 
Should you find driver security issues, we urge you to report them via https://github.com/fluffos/fluffos/issues.

Should you find internal mudlib security problems, bugs or abusable issues, report them at https://github.com/limalib/lima/issues/ or log onto LIMA via your favourite MUD client
and talk to us on limalib.dev 7878.
